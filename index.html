        <h3>The Sharp Increase of Online Shopping</h3>
        <p>The consumer landscape of today is one that is rapidly changing and is growing every day. As people spend more and more time online, the more they are bombarded by targeted ads that seem to know people better than they know themselves! As a result of this uprising of consumer information and what feels like your every move being tracked, more and more people find themselves buying online. For most, it's just easier to click buy online and forget about it until it arrives on your doorstep in a couple days (sometimes even the same day!).</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">AI chatbots are here to make your life easier</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">With an increasing amount of shopping being done online, consumers have been interacting with online chatbots more frequently. These little AI helpers come in many different ways. Sometimes they are mostly out of your way and waiting for you to directly interact with them and other times they can become a little too pesky and even annoying. For the most part, they are there to help your shopping experience be as smooth as possible. You have a question? They can provide an answer! You need to return something? A chatbot can potentially walk you through the process!</p>

        <h3>Different Types of Chatbots and False Information</h3>
        <p>There different levels of AI chatbots embeded in e-commerce websites today. They can range from chatbots that essentially just have a bunch of pre-recorded reesponses for the most commonly asked questions to a large language model (LLM) that can hold a conversation with you to the point where you may feel like you're talking to an actual person! Regardless of the type of AI chatbot you may be dealing with, it is important to know that AI is not perfect and may provide you with information that is false.</p>

        <h3>People enjoy using chatbots for simple requests</h3>
        <div class="info-4-main">
          <p>Consumers have busy lives and don't want to spend all day trying to figure out the return policy or how to go about returning an item. For these simple tasks, consumers are actually happy to interact with a chatbot. Consumers prefer to use chatbots for simple requests. Chatbots are available 24/7 and you are instantly connected to them on the website. Gone are the days where you are put on hold for several minutes just to ask a simple question. Effective chatbots can make consumer experience better in more ways than one. </p>
          <p>However, it is the case that customers prefer to interact with human representatives when dealing with more complex tasks. This stems from consumers having a lack of trust in AI to fulfill more demanding tasks and are willing to hold to talk to a human so that the request is fulfilled correctly. There has been new research targeted at getting consumers to put more trust in the capabilities of chatbots by including more charisma into their models. Overall, consumers are benefiting from the introduction of embeded chatbots.</p>

        <div class="info-4-main">
          <p>Interacting with chatbots doesn't come without fault. We highly advise against telling chatbots any personal information such that can be used to identify you or any private information such as credit card numbers or bank account numbers. These AI models collect all sorts of information and have the possibility of leaking any private information you tell it to other users. It also matters how each individual company is securing their databases and the information stored on them.</p>
          <p>Depending on the company there can be potentially large variations in the security of the information that that is being stored by the chatbot. Moving forward, it is important to understand that AI chatbot are by no means perfect and at the end of the day should not be the end all be all. If you question what a chatbot is telling you or you don't want to provide it with personal information it is best to reach out to a customer service representative for help.</p>
